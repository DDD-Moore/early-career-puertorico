### Expenses & Reimbursement

Below is a description of what expenses will be covered and how. 

_**Note: Receipts required for all expenses over $75**_

**Flight**: GBMF will cover flight expenses (see booking information above). You need to submit a receipt for reimbursement.

**Hotel**: GBMF will cover costs for your hotel room for May 30 check-in - June 3 check-out (minus incidentals). Additional nights are available at a reduced rate; you will be responsible for any additional nights.

**Food**: GBMF will be providing meals during the symposium, plus a meal stipend for your two travel days ($50 max per day). Receipts are not necessary for food costs.

**Other expenses**: GBMF will cover all other reasonable expenses, including ground transportation, incidentals, baggage fees etc. Receipts will be required for all expenses greater than $75. 

**Family care**: GBMF is pleased to offer family care support of up to $75 per day ($375 maximum) to attendees. The intention of these funds is to cover additional care for family members outside of regularly scheduled work hours and for the time required for travel to the workshop (e.g. evening or extended day care). You will not be required to provide receipts or otherwise substantiate the actual amount of costs that you incur. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the appropriate tax treatment of any payments received.

## Of Note

**International Researchers**

The responsibility for determining the ability of the participant to attend ultimately rests with the traveler. Please do any needed due diligence with your relevant travel/visa office. [More information from US Customs and Border Protection](https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/980/~/needing-a-passport-to-enter-the-united-states-from-u.s.-territories).

From what we know, there is no immigration control when traveling to/from Puerto Rico as departure/arrival is like any airport in the US: a TSA identification check and security screening. (There is also an agriculture check of bags prior to check-in, similar to when departing Hawaii — no ID needed for this.) That said, the [San Juan Luis Muñoz Airport](http://www.san-juan-airport.com/) states:

> Aliens traveling to Puerto Rico are required to have a valid passport and an appropriate US visa (if required).


**Health Concerns for Travel Puerto Rico**

Again, the traveler is responsible for determining health risks with any travel.

Check the [CDC website](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/puerto-rico) for the latest recommendations on traveling to Puerto Rico.
