## More information about Zika 

We have been closely monitoring the Zika virus and the effect it is having in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, and is expected to have in the continental United States. It is definitively of great concern to pregnant women, and according to the CDC, “Women who are pregnant should not travel to [areas with Zika](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-information).” It is difficult to know how much of the extensive news coverage about this disease is accurate or helpful in informing people of the impact of this virus or the risks of contracting it, and thus we offer some resources and information below that we have found helpful and science-based. Risks for travelers to Central and South America have long existed for Dengue, chikungunya, and other mosquito-borne diseases, and we understand that the recent outbreak of Zika is especially more worrisome for some people.
 
In terms of coming to Puerto Rico, we want you all to be comfortable and relaxed, in what we still believe is a special place for a retreat of this kind. If, for whatever reason, you feel that you cannot attend, we ask that you let us know as soon as possible. The decision to travel is optional and your participation in this event is completely up to you.
 
The entire organizing committee at Moore is committed to holding a singularly amazing event in Puerto Rico, and for those that attend, we will do everything in our power to provide a safe and intellectually stimulating experience. We will have varied activities and discussions at a world class hotel/resort, in comfortable, indoor and air-conditioned conference rooms, a night trip to a marine bioluminescent bay, wonderful food, and plenty of bug repellant and sunscreen! The resort is located on the windward side of the island, with a steady breeze, and the hotel staff have assured us that precautions have been taken to reduce the mosquito threat, including: 

- Applying preventative treatments throughout the entire resort
- Keeping all entryways to the outdoors closed
- Making sure air conditioning is available in all indoor spaces
- Offering EPA-registered insect repellent spray at no cost at all outdoor catering and banquet events as well as the resort’s pool, golf course, and tennis center

We will be sharing program details shortly, and in the meantime, if you would like to discuss anything in this note, or just have questions about the symposium, please feel free to contact the DDD team.
