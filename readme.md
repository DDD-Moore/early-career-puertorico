## Moore Postdoc and Early Career Symposium

**_May 31 - June 2, 2016 in Puerto Rico_**

**What:** Postdoc and Early Career researcher Symposium (PECS)

**Who:** About 50 PEC researchers funded by the Moore DDD Initiative. This includes PEC researchers at the three [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org) and those that are members of [DDD Investigators'](https://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/investigators) labs. See [attendees](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-puertorico/blob/master/attendees.md) for more details.

**Why:** You are all smart, driven individuals at the earlier stages of your careers. We want you to meet each other, collaborate, learn from one another, and potentially work together now or in the future. We are interested in building out a cohort of data science researchers that will hopefully persist well beyond the bounds of the meeting. 

The agenda will include a few interesting speakers, a panel or two on subjects relevant to the broader group, copious breaks and opportunities for informal interactions, a lot of talk about science, methods, and data, and plenty of time to enjoy the ambiance of Puerto Rico.

We will be co-located with PEC researchers from labs funded by the [Moore Marine Microbiology Initiative](https://www.moore.org/programs/science/marine-microbiology-initiative). We will be interacting informally with their group on Tuesday and Thursday (e.g., meals, activities) and more formally on Wednesday. Details to follow.

**When:** May 30 - June 3, 2016 (3 day symposium + 1 travel day on either side)

**Where:** Puerto Rico! We are finalizing the contract with the venue and will provide details soon. Suffice it to say you won't be disappointed!

## Deadlines

We need the final list of attendees by **Friday March 11**.

All attendees need to register by **Friday March 18**. Registration form will be sent via email.

More details on Logistics (travel, preparation, etc.) to follow.
