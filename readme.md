## THE SYMPOSIUM HAS BEEN CANCELED.

We regret to inform you that we have officially cancelled the upcoming Early Career Symposium  scheduled for May 30 - June 2, 2016. Due to the rising presence of Zika virus in Puerto Rico, the Foundation has determined that the summit should not take place at this time. We apologize for this late change in plans, and we realize that many of you will be disappointed by this decision.

We hope to reschedule but have not made any decisions yet. Unless you wish to keep your travel plans to Puerto Rico for personal purposes, please cancel your flights. We will reimburse you for any penalties resulting from flight cancellations, but please request a full refund since some airlines are offering full reimbursement for flights to Puerto Rico due to the Zika risk. If there any additional expenses incurred due to this late cancellation, please contact us and we will work with you to resolve the issue.

To request a reimbursement for cancellation fees etc., please submit the forms found on the [Logistics page](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-puertorico/blob/master/logistics.md#expenses--reimbursement) to [natalie.caulk@moore.org](mailto:natalie.caulk@moore.org).

Sincerely,
The DDD Team

### Basics

**Who:** About 50 early career researchers funded by the Moore DDD Initiative. This includes researchers at the three [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org), members of DDD Investigators' labs, and researchers affiliated with one of our "Practices" grants (Jupyter, Julia Language, or Data Carpentry). A list of confirmed attendees is available [here](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-puertorico/blob/master/attendees.md).

**Why:** We want to assemble a group of smart, driven individuals at the earlier stages of your careers to meet each other, learn from one another, and potentially work together now or in the future. We are interested in fostering a cohort of data science researchers that will hopefully persist well beyond the bounds of the meeting. 

We want your help in crafting the event! The agenda will include a few interesting speakers, a panel or two on subjects relevant to the broader group, copious breaks and opportunities for informal interactions, a lot of talk about science, methods, and data, and plenty of time to enjoy the ambiance of Puerto Rico.

We will be co-located with early career researchers from labs funded by the [Moore Marine Microbiology Initiative](https://www.moore.org/programs/science/marine-microbiology-initiative). We will be interacting informally with their group on Tuesday and Thursday (e.g., meals, activities) and more formally on Wednesday. Details to follow.

All attendees at our symposium are required to agree with the following code of conduct. [Read the code of conduct here](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-puertorico/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
