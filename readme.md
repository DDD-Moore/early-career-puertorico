## Moore Postdoc and Early Career Symposium

**_May 31 - June 2, 2016 in Puerto Rico_**

**What:** Postdoc and Early Career researcher Symposium (PECS)

**Who:** About 50 PEC researchers funded by the Moore DDD Initiative. This includes PEC researchers at the three [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org) and those that are members of [DDD Investigators'](https://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/investigators) labs. See [attendees](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-puertorico/blob/master/attendees.md) for more details.

**Why:** You are all smart, driven individuals at the earlier stages of your careers. We want you to meet each other, collaborate, learn from one another, and potentially work together now or in the future. We are interested in building out a cohort of data science researchers that will hopefully persist well beyond the bounds of the meeting. 

The agenda will include a few interesting speakers, a panel or two on subjects relevant to the broader group, copious breaks and opportunities for informal interactions, a lot of talk about science, methods, and data, and plenty of time to enjoy the ambiance of Puerto Rico.

We will be co-located with PEC researchers from labs funded by the [Moore Marine Microbiology Initiative](https://www.moore.org/programs/science/marine-microbiology-initiative). We will be interacting informally with their group on Tuesday and Thursday (e.g., meals, activities) and more formally on Wednesday. Details to follow.

**When:** May 30 - June 3, 2016 (3 day symposium + 1 travel day on either side)

**Where:** Puerto Rico! We are in final negotiations but the likely location will be the [Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort](http://www.wyndhamriomar.com/).

## Deadlines

We need the final list of [attendees](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-puertorico/blob/master/attendees.md) by **Friday March 11**.

All attendees need to register by **Friday March 18**. Registration form will be sent via email.

More details on logistics (travel, preparation, etc.) to follow.

## Of Note

**International PEC researchers**

There is no immigration control when traveling to/from Puerto Rico. Departure is like any airport in the US: a TSA identification check and security screening. (There is also an agriculture check of bags prior to check-in, similar to when departing Hawaii — no ID needed for this.) That said, the [San Juan Luis Muñoz Airport](http://www.san-juan-airport.com/) states:

> Aliens traveling to Puerto Rico are required to have a valid passport and an appropriate US visa (if required).

The responsibility will ultimately rest with the traveler to do any needed due diligence with the relevant travel/visa office. [More information from US Customs and Border Protection](https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/980/~/needing-a-passport-to-enter-the-united-states-from-u.s.-territories).



**Health Concerns for Travel Puerto Rico**

Check the [CDC website](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/puerto-rico) for the latest recommendations on traveling to Puerto Rico.

The CDC also provides information specific to the Zika virus for the Caribbean: [Zika Virus in the Caribbean](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-caribbean)
