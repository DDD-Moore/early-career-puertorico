## Information on Attendees

_**This page will be updated with attendee names and information once it's decided.**_

Each **DDD investigator** can send two postdoc/early-career (PEC) researchers from their lab (sorry, no grad students). If a lab doesn't have two postdocs to send, we will open up extra spots to other investigators that might have more than two (permission of course).

Each **Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment** can send six PEC researchers from their institution (no grad students or tenured/tenure track faculty). It’s up to the DSE to determine the process for deciding on the six researchers they will send. Please note that there may be one additional spot available per DSE depending on a few details to be determined. We will let you know as soon as possible if this is the case. In general, it might be wise to have a "waiting list" of PEC researchers just in case.

### More Details and Explanation

* The idea behind including “early career researchers” was to in inclusive of those individuals that not formally called postdocs but hold research positions and are early in their career (research scientists, research engineers, data scientists, etc.) We aren’t picky about the title, but rather are interested in getting folks at a similar level of experience and place in their career.

* PEC researchers at DSEs who happen to be ethnographers are welcome to come as participants. It should be clear that this event is not part of the DSE study, and they should plan to be full participants and set their DSE ethnographer role aside. The symposium is not part of the DSE study, but instead a networking and learning event.

* In 2016, we cannot accommodate additional PEC researchers beyond the 2/investigator and 6/DSE, regardless of who is paying their way. Some explanation:
	* This event is the first of its kind (for us), so it's serving as a bit of a prototype. Because of that, we'd like to keep it small. 
	* We are holding it in conjunction with our Marine Microbiology Initiative colleagues and their ~40 participants. Plus our ~50 participants, this is a total of close to 100 PEC researchers, which is a lot for us to manage given the program we are planning and the venue and location we selected.
	* If we did allow the DSEs and Investigators to add participants at their own expense, we run the risk of significantly expanding the number of people to well beyond capacity. 
	* We plan to hold something like this every year for the next two or three years, so this will not be the only opportunity for postdocs/early-career researchers to participate
	* We expect that next year we will be able to accommodate more than the 48 we have slated for 2016.
